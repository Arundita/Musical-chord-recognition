# Musical-chord-recognition
This project presents a method to perform chord recognition from live musical signals such as notes played form guitar, keyboard or flute using frequency spectrum analysis. Human vocal sounds can be analyzed with classical Fourier transform, however musical sounds are time varying signals occupying a wider band of frequencies as compared to human voice signals and cannot be sufficiently analyzed with classical Fourier transform techniques.
Time Frequency analysis is a suitable method to analyze music signals that play chords-a chord is a combination of two or more musical notes that combine harmoniously, time frequency analysis can be achieved using the STFT(short time fourier transform) that essentially divides the signal into small blocks and calculates the fourier transform of each individual block thus giving us an idea of more finer and all the frequency components present in the signal. Using STFT the spectrogram of the signal can be obtained which will separate out each chord giving the fundamental frequency of each note in the chord thereby making the analysis of the musical signal more effective.
